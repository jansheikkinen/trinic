# Examples
This is a collection of example programs written in UC.
As UC is in its infancy, nothing about it is set in stone; thus I cannot
guarantee that any of the examples work.
Feel free to try them out, but just know that they're here more to give viewers
a general idea of what UC may look like when complete.
